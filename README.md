- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jloftin,
- As a Customer Success Engineer at MathWorks, I help faculty and students utilize and implement MATLAB and Simulink into their research and teaching workflows. 

I am interested in all branches of mathematics. My research focuses on applied mathematics, specifically computational fluid dynamics, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. I am also interested in machine learning applications. Learning is something I am very passionate about, both for myself and others. I am always trying to learn new things in mathematics and other sciences. A deep understanding of pure and applied mathematics allows one to see novel applications and solve new problems. I am motivated to work and learn new skills!
